# Solitaire

Solitaire written with React + TypeScript + Vite.

No ads, no catch.

Changes here get ported over to the game, which is hosted [here](https://ryanshee.com/solitaire).

Source files are a submodule, which are located at [this repo](https://github.com/LIONisaQT/solitaire-src).

## How to run

Assuming you have NVM and Node 22 installed.

```bash
nvm use
npm i
npm run dev
```

### Why

For funsies + practice.

### Who

For my mom, who can't find free Solitaire in the wild without ads or forced account sign-ups.
